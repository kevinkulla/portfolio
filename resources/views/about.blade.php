        <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
        <p>Growing up, being a very visual thinker meant survival. I rush to translate pictures in my head into words before my mind changes channels. The relationship between entities in the world captures my focus more than the entities themselves. Constructing a mental-diorama around a single thought sparks an emotional bond, providing time for the idea to grow.</p>

        <p>Coping mechanisms I developed as a child guide my practice. At work, my emotions act as a string weaving memories, influences, and current events into emotionally-charged scenes. Unrefined edges remain as remnants from the urgency required to capture fickle ideas before they're gone.</p>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Kevin Kulla [b. 1990] is a Canadian figurative painter born and based in Peterborough, Ontario. Beginning without sketches or studies, Kevin constructs emotionally-driven scenes adorned with a wealth of playful details drawing inspiration from the connections his memories, and immediate influences share with his subject. His characteristically unrefined style was born from erratically bouncing around the canvas building layers of acrylic paint. Kevin was awarded a Certificate of Achievement from the Canadian Portrait Society for his work Self Portrait in the 2020 Canadian Portrait Competition, “The Miracle of the Portrait.” His work is held in private collections across North America.</p>
